# Online Music/Movie Recommendation System

This project is a Python-based application that recommends music and movies based on user preferences and external data from APIs like Spotify. The application uses multiple libraries, including streamlit for the user interface, spotipy for Spotify API integration, and nltk for natural language processing.

# Features

- Music and Movie Recommendations: Personalized recommendations based on user input and preferences.
- Spotify API Integration: Fetch real-time song data using spotipy.
- Streamlit Interface: A user-friendly web interface built using streamlit.
- Data Persistence: Save and load user preferences using pickle.
- Text Processing: Leverage the nltk library for natural language understanding and content analysis.

# Tech Stack
- Python: The core programming language used.
- Streamlit: For creating a responsive web interface.
- Spotipy: Spotify API integration for music recommendations.
- nltk: Natural language processing for analyzing content.
- Pickle: For saving and loading data.

# Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

# Install the required libraries:

- pip install streamlit spotipy nltk

# How to Run
Clone the repository:

- git clone : https://github.com/SachinMaurya2002/Online-Music-Movie-Recommendation-System

- cd- online-music-movie-recommender

# Install dependencies:

- pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download necessary nltk resources:

- import nltk
- nltk.download()

- Set up Spotify API credentials by creating an app on Spotify for Developers and retrieve your client ID and client secret.

Create a .env file to store your Spotify credentials:

- SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id'
- SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret'

@ - Run the application:

- streamlit run app.py

- Open the app in your web browser to start getting personalized recommendations.
